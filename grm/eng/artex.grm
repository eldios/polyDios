 		 "every building has things that people like to point out, quirks of history that come to define it" |
 		 "there is maybe a sense of other times in this work, within the present tense transmitted to the screen"|
 		 "the work does result from an awareness of the kinds of activity: collecting, analysing and sharing data"|
 		 Artist " physically engages the surface of all the abstract works"|
 		 "in both media, drawings as well as paintings, linear segments or surfaces are built through accumulation"|
 		 "there is a naturalistic quality of light that creates an immediate connection to this as a world we know but yet have never experienced before"|
 		 "the layers of time and place involved in the works of art presented engage the viewer in the complexity and awareness of the situation"|
 		 "the art of" Artist ^" emphasises an awareness of" Subject|
 		 Artist ^"'s work confronts the spectator, while distancing him/her from their intense experience"|
 		 Artist "investigates the interplay of time and space, the now and the before, and the way we can relate to their perceptions"|
 		 Artist ^"'s nearly imperceptible sound paths unconsciously stop the visitors in their tracks"|
 		 "all art works are derived from a particular situation and consciousness, extracting observations and private histories from the artists' archive of personal experiences"| 
 		 "the current works represent earth art that celebrates how we're all connected on the one web of life"|
 		 Artist ^"'s works are characterized by a clear vocabulary"|
 		 "all around us the fundamentals of life are crying out to be shaped or created"|
 		 "the new works reflect the artist's ambition to capture his own experiences and observations in such a poetic and abstract manner"|
		 "the current tension and diverging statements in art challenges us to re-evaluate our personal criteria in the composing of visual concepts"|
		 "the title of the project captures the described image and concept"|
		 "the starting point for" Opera^" is the corner, 'the boundary between interior and exterior', between indoors and outdoors, between" Adj^" and "^Adj|
		 "the installations of" Artist ^"- sometimes called" Titolo^" by the artist - cast their spell over the viewer at first glance"|

Prop2 ::= "that is the transformations and the invented narratives through thousands of repetitive images" | 
		 "the primary form will refer to the human figure and/or forms found in geographical landscape"| 
		 "it is the ability of text to stimulate our imaginations and to communicate images and meanings to each of us" |
		 "as readers, we fill in the gaps of her text and imagine far more than what we see, carrying our own interpretation of the lines" |
		 "there is some idea of an almost physiological study of" Subject^", of considering it as though it were an organism"|
		 "but the images themselves are distorted in ways quite unlike those made through microscopes" |
		 "that contrast between areas in and out of focus, exaggerates the sharpness in the central area" |
		 "there is something quite important about this central focus to the images" |
		 "it's a sense of active seeking and scrutiny"|
		 "we never think about it"|
		 "we find that in the hidden spaces"|
		 "there is an archaeology of" Subject " and of people living and working with that"|
		 "but there is still something inhuman about this work"|
		 "the changes that are theoretically visible over time will never be registered by the eye"|
		 "this work may then in turn have serious relevance to human needs and the formulation of policies"|
		 "the results of the research could have impact across the globe"|
		 "just being in this place changes anyone's awareness"|
		 "each image emerges as a kind of performance of applying paint, rubbing, erasing, sanding and reapplication until the moment of completion"|
		 "the final work exists as a result of its own history, resonating with the memory of each mark"|
		 "together these elements form within their layering an illusion of architectural dimensionality which never denies its inherent flatness"|
		 "at the same time a biomorphic quality is acquired through partial erasure, bleeding and multiple applications"|
		 "the resulting images present abstract forms merging with a visceral landscape, simultaneously appearing to be drawn from such traditions as Islamic ornamentalism or the Ecole de Paris and a futuristic, space-age biomorphicism"|
		 "leading to new ways of exploring and understanding individual circumstances"|
		 "there is the immediate visual, three-dimensional impact"|
		 "the use of vivid colors, often primary, and of mirror effects playing on light to create the desired atmosphere"|
		 "the use of pre-recorded soundtracks to accentuate this atmosphere"|
		 "the use of texts or single words to engage the viewer"|
		 "the use of lettering as a means of contributing to the atmosphere and playing on perception"|
		 "however, there is a sub-text, a slight twist, a sideswipe at conformism, a throwing off-balance both physical and mental"|
		 "it is up to the viewer to decide whether to immerse in the sub-text, whether or not to participate in the scenario"|
		 "this consciousness prompts the artists to deal with the political, the geographical, and the everyday in a non-didactic way"|
		 "no conclusions drawn, however"|
		 "rather than a single obvious reading, there are several readings that are available"|
		 "a constant oscillation between reality and fiction, fiction and documentary, the communal and the private realm of the individual is offered"|
		 "is a segment between two points"|
		 "it is not a departure nor an arrival"|
		 "but a moment that almost functions as a number of stills that are isolated from a film creating a new situation"|
		 "through this, it relaxes our impulse for a historically conditioned static viewing of this abstract work"|
		 "that engages a revitalized appreciation of the genre"|
		 "the artist uses a quasi-scientific presentation of data"|
		 "while the work documents a personal approach to investigating questions about" Subject^" and "^Subject|
		 "after all, the information it reveals is easily accessible to anyone who wants it"|
		 ["displayed on an eye-level platform that snakes through the gallery,"]"the installation reiterates the performative aspects of the making of the work"|
		 "in that way it leads us to view the world around us differently"|
		 "the unique design of these works takes them beyond the realm of a cultural craft into sculpture and mixed media, beyond any simplistic categorization"|
		 "this is the crucial fact we've to realise, and this broader concept of creativity is" Artist^"'s concept of art"|
		 "everybody can determine the content of life in his particular sphere"|
		 "our idea of culture is severely restricted because we've always applied it to art"|
		 "our concept of art must be universal and have an interdisciplinary nature"|
		 "the success of" Opera " lies in this very process"|
		 "at the same time the work represents the ultimate symbol of the cycle of life"|
		 "it symbolizes the artist's optimistic belief in beauty and change"|
		 "even if it deals with currently important themes like" Subject^", "^Subject^" or "^Subject|
		 "personal desires and fears remain the starting point for artist practice"|
		 "another, equally important aspect of this work is the search for beauty in the world around"|
		 "this poetic work is exemplary of" Artist^" eye for detail"|
		 "the artist fills seemingly simple images with light and air to evoke a sense of purity and serenity"|
		 "we are faced with what appears to be a direct transcription of the impossible"|
		 "images are exactly truthful representations of what they record, the strangeness they represent is all carefully setup before the shot is taken"|
		 "the relationship of the fictional world to reality is reflected in the constant preoccupation with the relationship of photography to painting and of either to experience reality"|
		 "if presented in that way, figures give to the sign which they produce, "literature" and that, in turn, is easily appropriated by myth"|
		 "within each work a 'statement' functions to describe the continuum within a balance of constants and variables"|
		 "that gives to its percipient the information that joins with whatever is represented as visual"|
		 "we see the image, which is the 'work' produced by the percipient as an event in his or her time"|	 
		 "illustrating subject matter to the viewer is not artist primary concern"|
		 "these objects are indeed more closely related to fables than to inventories, as much about what is implied as what is delineated"|
		 Artist^"'s objects are" Object^", "^Object^" and "^Object|
		 "this art immerses viewers into the magic by which paint transforms itself into things being described and back again"|
		 "the artist places provocative and beautifully rendered objects such as " Object^" and "^Object|
 		 "we are forced to explore the question of how the museum consciously or unconsciously perpetuates beliefs and behavior"|
 		 "consciously or unconsciously, the setting of the image expresses the particular sensitivity of the viewer"|
		 "this principle reveals purity in sensuality which never ceases to move us"|
		 "this art, a sophisticated gaze, pursues the permanence of a gesture or a presence"|
