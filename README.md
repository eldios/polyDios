# eldios nodejs Polygen magical wrapper
This simple project is a wrapper around the polygen fantastic utility. I provided the binary (but you can use yours) in the bin directory and an english grammar as a test.
With these simple contents you should be ready to go

# DISCLAIMER
I'm not involved in polygen development but since it's a GPL software (and zombie project) I provided the binary and some grammars. 
You can find full sources (& grammars) here http://polygen.org/dist/polygen-1.0.6-20040628-src.zip
